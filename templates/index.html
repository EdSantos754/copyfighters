		<h2>Our proposals</h2>
		<p>Over the past year, we worked together with more than 100 young European from 25 different European countries to understand the real-life problems young people experience with copyright and to come up with proposals what to do about that.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>
				<h4>End Territoriality</h4>
				<p class="position-text">We share the deep belief that territorial copyright with different legislation in different countries is not in line with the borderless nature of the Internet. The countries of the world should agree upon a single copyright standard clarifying the confusion of interjurisdictional issues on the Internet. We believe the European Union stands in an excellent position to lead the way by creating a digital single market. Therefore, we call on the European Union to set an example in harmonising copyright legislation by introducing a single European copyright title.</p>
				<p class="position-text">← Back</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-youtube-play"></i>
				<h4>Stop Geoblocking</h4>
				<p class="position-text">Many young people move to other European countries and travel regularly. The Internet and social media have made a huge impact on sharing and communicating with people internationally. The Internet has also made people aware of many cultural goods and services. However, many barriers exist and Europeans are finding it increasingly difficult to have access to the same goods and services that are available in their home countries, and vice versa. For example, when it comes to audio-visual content, it is important to have legally available services that are high in demand and that people want to consume. Furthermore, geoblocking hinders new business models for creating cultural works and needs to be ended to significantly reduce piracy, as it is often impossible to legally access the works people are interested in.</p>
				<p class="position-text">← Back</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-refresh fa-spin"></i>
				<h4>Allow fair use</h4>
				<p class="position-text">Existing copyright legislation has in practice proven to be unenforceable in a digital environment. Significant portions of the population engage on a day-to-day basis in online activities such as image sharing, which are often illegal. Besides the effects this has on users it also discourages new businesses from emerging due to legal uncertainty. Users should be protected through the introduction of flexible exceptions to copyright legislation.</p>
				<p class="position-text">Fair use should have an open definition which would allow for the inclusion of future technologies and business models. We propose the introduction of a fair use exception, in order to enable future uses and allow for case-by-case judgements for copyright cases. Furthermore, basic copyright exceptions and limitations, like freedom of panorama and parody, should be harmonized in all EU countries.</p>
				<p class="position-text">← Back</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-filter"></i>
				<h4>No automated filters</h4>
				<p class="position-text">New platforms and technologies help lower the barriers for people to access art and culture. At the same time, these platforms and the content they disseminate create new challenges. While there is sometimes a need to remove content from these platforms, it is important to safeguard user’s rights when doing so:</p>
				<ul class="position-text">
					<li>Intermediaries must only remove content in accordance with publicly available content removal procedures, follow due process, exercise tests of necessity and proportionality, and provide appeal mechanisms to an independent and impartial actor.</li>
					<li>Governments, intermediaries, and civil society should work together to develop a framework for periodic, independent and impartial reviews of the intermediary’s content restriction policies and assess their impact on human rights</li>
					<li>The implementation of automated content recognition systems should not be imposed by law. If intermediaries opt to implement such systems voluntarily, it is important that they safeguard fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression, as well as respect copyright exceptions and limits.</li>
					<li>The law should make distinction between the platforms by content type (data hosting providers, publishing platforms, search engines, payment systems, and so forth) and by scale. No administrative, financial or technological barriers should be created for new market entrants.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="position-text">← Back</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-recycle"></i>
				<h4>Support remix culture</h4>
				<p class="position-text">The undetermined legal status of remix works that extend from visual arts to fan fiction is a significant issue which prevents us from active participation in a democracy where we are not merely recipients but rather creators of new meaning.</p>
				<p class="position-text">Commercial companies threaten small actors who manage to attract audiences with their new creative works which are based on copyrighted materials. Many such works fall into a category of transformative works which bring renewed creative value, boost arts and sciences, which is a purpose of copyright; such works are a promotion of copyrighted works, however this potential is not explored and small creators are still treated as criminals.</p>
				<p class="position-text">It is important to protect small creators from such threats posed by big companies by bringing more clarity on the terms of use of both copyrighted and out of copyright works.</p>
				<ul class="position-text">
					<li>Introduction of an exception for non-commercial user-generated content, compensated by collective licensing in case of commercial use.</li>
					<li>No copyright claim on digital copies of public domain (out-of-copyright) artistic works in any format.</li>
					<li>Simplified copyright clearance process for GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums).</li>
					<li>International legal compatibility with the Creative Commons licensing model for digital content available for creative repurposing.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="position-text">← Back</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 position">
				<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>
				<h4>Open Access & Education</h4>
				<p class="position-text">We experience barriers when trying to access scientific works for our studies and education. We believe that everyone would benefit from an open access regime, therefore all research that is partially or fully publicly funded should by default be released into the public domain. To further lower the paywall of the current publishing system, we believe that peer review should become the focal point of reform, so that we establish alternative means of validating research besides few large publications.</p>
				<p class="position-text">A clearly defined exception for educational purposes, both formal and informal, must be added to the harmonised copyright laws to enable all forms of learning, including sharing materials freely in class or during extracurricular activities and even for self-learning. Teachers should be allowed to spontaneously use resources from the Internet in education and show them to pupils and students without a bureaucratic licensing process. Support for researchers in negotiations with publishers to allow open access to research in repositories.</p>

This proposed amendment (which has not yet been incorporated into the Directive) provides that using content already made available online for purposes such as criticism, review, illustration, caricature, or parody is lawful provided the source is accurately identified and the use is consistent with fair practice.

				<h4>{% trans 'What was the problem?' %}</h4>
				<p>{% trans 'The reason behind this proposal was to remedy the so-called “value gap”. The value gap is the disparity between the large revenues of large online platforms such as Google and Facebook, and the low revenues of press publishers. It was intended as a way of redistributing Google’s revenues to small publishers. The reality is far less straightforward: the resulting proposal will not only fail to redistribute Google’s revenues to those who need it, but it will also hamper our ability as online users to engage with one another on the internet.' %}</p>
				<h4>{% trans 'Here’s why the Commission’s proposal won’t solve the problem' %}</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>{% trans 'In Spain where a snippet levy is in place, Google has not paid a share of their advertisement-based revenues to news publishers. Instead, it has simply stopped publishing links to Spanish publishers. It is likely that other social networks will limit their users’ ability to share such links if this Directive comes into effect, thus threatening our freedom of information and limiting our right to be informed' %}</li>
					<li>{% trans 'News publishers will have the right to sue individual website owners and to ask for licence fees whenever their links are being shared, hindering the ability of individuals to share new ideas and important information.' %}</li>
					<li>{% trans 'Advertisement-based clickbait and low-quality news providers which do not charge to share their links could prosper to the detriment of more reputable news sources.' %}</li>
					<li>{% trans 'This will have a negative impact on competition and innovation: European start-ups will be unable to pay for link snippets, and thus will either be unable to compete with existing platform monopolies such as Google or Facebook or will need to launch outside of the European Union.' %}</li>

The problem is that some of the content uploaded on the Internet infringes the copyright of other content creators.

				<h4>{% trans 'The proposal is problematic…' %}</h4>
				<p>{% trans 'If you have ever uploaded content to social media, or watched a creative video someone else uploaded, this proposed reform could affect you. This proposal would require intermediaries such as Facebook and YouTube to constantly police their platforms with censorship machines, often with no human element involved in the process. These mechanisms will be expensive to implement. They will make it harder for European start-ups to grow, and for individuals to understand how their content is being manipulated.' %}</p>
				<h4>{% trans 'Will the proposal fix the problem?' %}</h4>
				<p>{% trans 'No. The proposed censorship machines are a disproportionate and ineffective ‘solution’ to the problem. We know this, because in the case of SABAM v Netlog, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled social networks and other web hosting providers cannot be required to monitor and filter activities that occur on their sites to prevent copyright infringement. This would be a breach of freedom of expression and of privacy (CJEU C-360/10).' %}</p>
