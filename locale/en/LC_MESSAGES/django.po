msgid ""
"The reason behind this proposal was to remedy the so-called “value gap”. The "
"value gap is the disparity between the large revenues of large online "
"platforms such as Google and Facebook, and the low revenues of press "
"publishers. It was intended as a way of redistributing Google’s revenues to "
"small publishers. The reality is far less straightforward: the resulting "
"proposal will not only fail to redistribute Google’s revenues to those who "
"need it, but it will also hamper our ability as online users to engage with "
"one another on the internet."

"In Spain where a snippet levy is in place, Google has not paid a share of "
"their advertisement-based revenues to news publishers. Instead, it has "
"simply stopped publishing links to Spanish publishers. It is likely that "
"other social networks will limit their users’ ability to share such links if "
"this Directive comes into effect, thus threatening our freedom of "
"information and limiting our right to be informed"
